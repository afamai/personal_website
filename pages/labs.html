	<p><a href="labs/lab3/homepage.html">Lab 3</a> - This lab demonstrate the use of the Bootstrap buttons and grid system. AS well as more practice with CSS.<br><b>Note :</b> Only the lab3 button works.</p><br>
	<p><a href="labs/lab4/form.html">Lab 4 Part 1</a> - This is a simple Perl script that just prints "This is my first Perl program."</p><br>
	<p><a href="http://www2.scs.ryerson.ca/~a4mai/cgi-bin/part1.cgi">Lab 4 Part 2</a> - Using a Perl, CGi and HTML form, the form will submit the information to the script and create a visually pleasing webpage.</p><br>
	<p><a href="labs/lab5/part1.php">Lab 5 Part 1</a> - Using a HTML form as input, a PHP program will use the inputted information and create a multiplication table between 3x3 and 12x12.</p><br>
	<p><a href="http://webdev.scs.ryerson.ca:8080/a4mai/labs/lab5/part2.asp">Lab 5 Part 2</a> - Similar to part 1, a HTML form is used to create a query string and it is submit it to a ASP program, where it would generate a webpage with the selected background</p><br>
	<p><a href="labs/lab6/form.html">Lab 6</a> - Using a HTML form as input, a JavaScript program is used to validate the form. The form is then submitted to a Ruby program, where it uses jQuery to make buttons fade the information in and out.<br></p>
	<p><a href="labs/lab7/part1.html">Lab 7 part 1</a> Given this <a href="http://107.170.98.130/yr2/cache_yr2.txt">link</a>, which contains an XML file describing a song currently being played at a radio station. I created a JavaScript program which converts the XML file into an attractive webpage that displays the songs information.<br></p>
	<p><a href="labs/lab7/part2.html">Lab 7 part 2</a> Similar to part 1 we are given a different <a href="http://107.170.98.130/yr4/cache_yr4.txt">link</a>, which is a different XML file about another songs being played at another radio station. 
    However this time I created a Python program that will convert the XML file to JSON and use a different JavaScript program to display the information.<br><br>For Lab 7 I also wrote a bash script that will download the 2 files from the links every 5 mins using the <code>crontab</code> command and covert the part 2 link into a JSON file. That way everytime a user visits my site, they will always get the most updated information. <br></p>
